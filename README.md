# Gmail Latch

Small PoC to protect a Gmail account with Latch.

**Dependencies:**

```

* LatchSDK

> ###Disclaimer###
>This is a simple PoC. Code requires several improvements. This software may not work in the future if Gmail HTML changes. Idea based on [latch-facebook-hack](https://github.com/jaesga/latch-facebook-hack).
